This is an implementation of a scanner for the language Crux.

Scanner - reads each character from a file and generates a token depending on the lexeme encountered.

Token - represents the stuff encountered in Crux: identifiers, integer, float, etc.

Compiler - takes a file, scans it, and prints out the tokens encountered.
